# BigNum Library

## ⚠️ Warning

> - **Note:** This project is not yet organized.
> - **Note:** Some core functionalities of this library are also not yet finished.

## Description

**BigNum** is a C99 library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, optimized for large integers with support for 32-bit or 64-bit word sizes.
It is inspired by the [OpenSSL BIGNUM library](https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man3/bn/)  & [libtommath](https://github.com/libtom/libtommath) and aims to provide operations for manipulating large numbers.
## Purpose

The BigNum library is being implemented as the foundational component for future projects, particularly for implementing the some cryptography algorithms.

## Current Status

The library is not complete. Core functionalities, such as certain operations (`bn_exp`, `bignum_gcd`, `bignum_mod_exp`, `bignum_mod_inverse`) are not implemented yet.
